# About

We wish to build community around the practice of live coding while being open and interested in any other forms of creativity and imagination. So, regardless of whether you are a seasoned live coder wishing to jam, an artist interested in coding, a coder interested in the arts, or anybody curious enough and wishing to connect with others - come and join us, we would love to see you!

This is a (provisional) code of conduct which should mediate our interactions: [https://forum.toplap.org/t/code-of-conduct/1761](https://forum.toplap.org/t/code-of-conduct/1761)
